Ever died in a hard boss fight with a friend on Mediumcore, managed to recover your items but died again in the process of organizing your inventory and equiping all of them again? Your problems are over with this! When died we take a snap of your inventory and when you recover your items, they'll go to the same place it was before! You can even assign a key in control options to help manually equip items you got =)

The mod can already equip item with Q. It caches the player's inventory when died and when the player recover its items, it goes to the exact same slot as it was before

This mod is made using tModLoader
